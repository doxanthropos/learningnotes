#### Information request

#### Service fullfillment request

#### New service request

#### Incident resolution request

> issue once, then the issue will
> occur again!
>

> we reimage the machine."
>

### Flow Chart Processes

- Record the Users Information: Who is the user? What is their contact information?
- How to classify the request? Is is a knowledge question? Is it an issue? Is it a service request?
- Resolve the request? Using the knowledge base, escalating.
- Confirm and close the request: make sure that the issue is resolved, before closing the request. Don't close tickets, without having some form of contact with the user.
- Ensure quality service

## Implementing a Troubleshooting FAQ Knowledge Base

### What is a Knowledge Base / FAQ

Knowledge bases can be internal or external.

Knowlege base
: A technology used to store complex structured and unstructured information used by a computer system.

#### Values

- Team cross training
- First call problem resolution
- Improves time to resolution
- Overall improved support model

#### FAQ

- Often shared with the entire organization or even outside
- Solving repeatable issues
- Repeatable procedures

#### Choosing a CMS

- Email is not a CMS!
- Version control is necessary!
- Backup and recovery is also necessary: there needs to be a process for when the CMS fails.
- Ease of use! If it is not easy, it will not be used.

### Cross Training Value

- Preserving article versions: seeing change history without the people who did the change
- Offer to organizational users
- "Document it! Don't wait for perfection"
- Cross-link articles
- Only knowledge base! It is near impossible to work with more than one knowledge base in one organization!

#### Why setup a KB

- Self-service/FAQ options: To make sure people know about this it has to also be used when answering tickets.
- Train and educate staff
- Known issues and fixes
- Provide tools to users

### Supportive Team Environment

- Documentation
- Cross-training

>
> "Train people well enough so they
> can leave, treat them well enough
> so they don't want to."
> -- Richard Branson

- Develop training: Shows understanding of an issue
- Problem solving
