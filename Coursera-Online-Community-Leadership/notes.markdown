# Your Role in the Coursera Community

## Community Leader

Community Leaders manage a complete forum about one topic, for example AI.
Members can apply to become a community leader and get their own forum. The descision will be based on their previous engagement as a Community Helper or a Community Supporter.

## Community Supporter

This is not an official title or role, but describes people who take on some responsibility for engaging with the people in the forums and starting new discussions

## Community Helper

Again not an offical role or title. The main difference to the supporter seems to be that supporters are considered more reative, answering peoples questions and not so much driving the engagement on their own.

## Mentor

Mentors help out with specific courses and are recruite by the creators of a course (partners) not by Coursera themselve.
They are usually people who have completed the courses that they are responsible for and have been helpful by doing so.
