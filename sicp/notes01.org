* Forword

"Since large programs grow from small ones, it is crucial that we develop an arsenal of standard program structures of whose correctness we have become sure--we call them idioms--and learn to combine them into larger structures using organizational techniques of proven value."

This is done through practice in this book, but other later books, like the Gang of Four, Designpatterns book, can be seen as a continuation of this goal.
