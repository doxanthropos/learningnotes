## Planning for Data Recovery

### What is Data Recovery?

<blockquote>
Data recovery
The process of trying to restore data after an unexpected event that results in data loss or corruption
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
When an unexpected event occurs, your main objective is to <strong>resume normal operations</strong> as soon as possible, while minimizing the disruption of business functions.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
The best way to be prepared for a data-loss event is to have a well-thought-out <strong>disaster plan and procedure</strong> in place.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Disaster plans should involve <strong>making regular backups</strong> of any and all critical data that's necessary for your ongoing business processes.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
A <strong>post-mortem</strong> is a way for you to document any problems you discovered along the way, and most importantly, the way you fixed them so you can make sure they don't happen again.

### Testing Backups

<blockquote>
Restoration procedures
Should be documented and accessible so that anyone with the right access can restore operations when needed
</blockquote>

Regularly test documentation!

Simulate disaster events to test the disaster recovery!

### Types of Backup

Ways to Perform Regular Backups:

- Full Backup
- Differential Backup
- Regular Incremental Backups

<blockquote>
It's a good practice to perform infrequent full backups, while also doing more frequent differential backups.

<blockquote>
Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID)
A method of taking multiple physical disks and combining them into one large virtual disk

### What's a Disaster Recovery Plan?

<blockquote>
Disaster recovery plan
A collection of documented procedures and plans on how to react and handle an emergency or disaster scenario, from the operational perspective
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Preventive measures
Any procedures or systems in place that will proactively minimize the impact of a disaster
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Detection measures
Meant to alert you and your team that a disaster has occurred that can impact operations
</blockquote>

Example aspects:

- Environmental Sensors
- Flood Sensors
- Temp and Humidity Sensors
- Evacuation Procedures

<blockquote>
Corrective or recovery measures
Those enacted after a disaster has occurred
