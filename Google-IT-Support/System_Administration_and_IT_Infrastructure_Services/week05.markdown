## Planning for Data Recovery

### What is Data Recovery?

<blockquote>
Data recovery
The process of trying to restore data after an unexpected event that results in data loss or corruption
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
When an unexpected event occurs, your main objective is to <strong>resume normal operations</strong> as soon as possible, while minimizing the disruption of business functions.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
The best way to be prepared for a data-loss event is to have a well-thought-out <strong>disaster plan and procedure</strong> in place.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Disaster plans should involve <strong>making regular backups</strong> of any and all critical data that's necessary for your ongoing business processes.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
A <strong>post-mortem</strong> is a way for you to document any problems you discovered along the way, and most importantly, the way you fixed them so you can make sure they don't happen again.
