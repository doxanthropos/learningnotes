## System Administration Tasks

### Organizational Policies

#### Questions

- Should users be allowed to install software?
- Should users have complex passwords with certain requirements?
- Should users be allowed to access non-work-related websites, like Facebook?
- If you hand out a company phone to an employee, should you set a device password?

### User and Hardware Provisioning

Hardware Lifecycle Stages:

- Procurement
- Deployment

### Routine Maintenance


You can never know enough!

## Applying Changes

### With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility

Respect the rights of others.
Don't misuse the admin rights.

Writing out the steps you are going to do, will help not to rush and also document.

Documentation and version management will help prepare for necessary rollbacks.
