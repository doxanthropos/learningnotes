### Virtualization

Why virtualization?

- Performance: Dedicated hardware will have better performance
- Cost: One server for many applications is cheaper than many smaller ones for each
- Maintenance: With virtual servers, migrating stopping and restarting servers is easier
- Points-of-Failure: with virtual servers the services are not bound to the machine they are running on and can be easily moved to another -> Backups
