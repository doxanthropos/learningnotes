## How to create and test a disaster recovery plan

> "Tomorrows crisis is inevitable."

Testing is important: things might change and the plan might have to change accordingly.

Test for unavailability of random people.

### Questions that have to be answered by a plan

- Who: define roles and responsibilities
- What: grouping applications (Mission Critical, Important, Low Priority)
- When: ... to start
- Where: .. are the backups, is the crisis manual? (Don't have the manual on the same server that could be going down. Paper is goot here.)
- Why?
- How ... do we get everything back to normal?

## How to effectively communicate with your team during times of crisis

- Gather input
- Show flexibility
- Trust your team
- Difficult conversations need to remain private!
- Be patient: people, especially yourself, will slip back to their core personalities, even when they learned to behave differently in the job

Modes of communication might change during the day: phone calls at the start of day, messages during the day, mails at night for example.

## How to *show up* in your interactions with your team

- Pay attention: some people will be fine, some won't. Show you care and give the benefit of doubt
- Show empathy
- Are you fit to lead? If not .. delegate completely. -> People to delegate to should be known beforehand in the plan.
- Set a good example: Say what you do (transparent), do what you say (honest)
